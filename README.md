# EDA-of-VTubers-Sphere
Exploratory data analysis of VTubers' industry. Analysis is carried out with Jupyter Notebook using selenium web-scrap, pandas, matplotlib, plotly and ipywidgets by Sadr Galamat, student of Astana IT University. All the data was obtained from the Playboard, YouTube, Twitch, Virtual YouTuber Userlocal and Kaggle, all links are included in the project itself.

***Important: 1. Unfortunately GitHub doesn't allow uploading too big files, so I provided link to the google drive with all data that was obtained and used in the project.***
***2. GitHub also can't render plotly graphs, so feel free to download included HTML files to see them***
***3. GitHub cannot render ipywidgets functions, so download files if you want to see them***
